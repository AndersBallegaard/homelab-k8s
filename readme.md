# Homelab
This is a very much work in progress repository for migrating all (or atleast most) of my homelab to k8s

This repo is intentionally public to act as inspiration to others, and force me to think more about security

## Project structure
- For setup and cluster management see [admin/readme.md](admin/readme.md)
- For services running on the cluster see [the cluster dir](cluster)
