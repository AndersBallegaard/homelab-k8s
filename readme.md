# Homelab
Welcome to my Kubernetes homelab

A constant work in progress built for learning and hosting personal services.

# Objectives
- Create an IPv6 only kubernetes cluster
- Make sure everything works well enough to pass the official CNCF k8s conformance testing
- Everything should be controlled though repeatable gitops based workflows
- Document everything both for my own benifit and for others to benifit from
- Do it all in the public (Hello)

# Apps running on the cluster,
For a more complete list please refer to the [documentation](https://homelab.anderstb.dk/apps/apps/)

I classify the apps running on the cluster in two catagories: Infrastructure, and Services

### Services
- **Ollama + Open-webui** - Locally hosted AI chatbots, for private and secure AI without any ratelimits

### Infrastructure apps
- **Hubble UI** - Observability tool for cilium
- **Capacitor** - UI for FluxCD

# Getting started
Want to spin up the cluster with the exact same settings as me? Please see the [Getting started readme](https://github.com/AndersBallegaard/homelab-k8s/blob/main/admin/readme.md) 

Want to know where to find everything?
In the git repo there is the following main folders 

* [**admin**](https://github.com/AndersBallegaard/homelab-k8s/tree/main/admin) This directory stores anything related to cluster bootstrapping, admin node setup, etc
* [**cluster**](https://github.com/AndersBallegaard/homelab-k8s/tree/main/cluster) This is the directory FluxCD scans for new manifests to apply to the cluster.
* [**Conformance**](https://github.com/AndersBallegaard/homelab-k8s/tree/main/conformance) Everything related to Kubernetes conformance testing, INCLUDING TEST REPORTS!!!
* [**docs**](https://github.com/AndersBallegaard/homelab-k8s/tree/main/docs) Documentation, if you want a more readable version, please see [The project documentation site](https://homelab.anderstb.dk/)
