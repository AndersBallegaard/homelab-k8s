# About this documentation
Documentation in this repository is automaticly put toghther from templates, 
this is done to have a single source to update if a section is needed multiple places 
like a doc page, and a readme page for a part of subdirectory

## How to add to this documentation
### Create new section
First create a directory for the section, and a jinja template file
```bash
# Make directory and empty jinja file
mkdir -p docs/example
touch docs/example/example.jinja

# All files should include footer containing warning not to edit md files directly
echo '{% include "docs/footer.section" %}' >> docs/example/example.jinja
```
This page should be added to the nav section of mkdocs.yaml, see the file or mkdocs documentation for how to do this
### Add page to existing section
Create a new file inside the directory you want to add to.
The file should follow the 'relevant_name.section' naming scheme.
Treat this file as a markdown file, and add the content you want


Once you are ready to include it in the documentation add a line to the directorys .jinja file, the line should look something like below
```
{% include "example/world_domination.section" %}
```
Note, this should always be placed above the footer inclusion
