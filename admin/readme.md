# Lab admin
This directory contains scripts and configuration related to lab administration

## Prepare admin node
To convert an ubuntu machine to an admin node run this command.
This script uses git over SSH, so make sure the admin node have ssh keys created, and those keys have been added to github

The script does the following
- Installs openTofu
- Installs git
- Downloads this repository
- Installs talosctl
- Installs kubectl
- Installs helm
- Installs flux
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndersBallegaard/homelab-k8s/refs/heads/main/admin/prepare_admin_node.sh | bash
```

## Prepare proxmox for cloudinit
In case proxmox isn't ready for cloudinit of talos, this is how to set it up. Currently this is done from the proxmox UI as a one of thing
```bash
# Download a talos image from the talos image factory, it needs to be a nocloud image
# The image should be placed under the name "talos-nocloud-amd64.iso" in the shared vm datastore

# Create a VM with the 1g disk on shared storage, and attach the iso. Ram and CPU doesn't matter
# Don't start the VM
# The vm MUST be named talos-template, and should have the ID 9100
# CPU Type should be host for best performace
# Disk size is intentionally below recormendations for faster template deployments, cloud init will resize to whatever the VM is speced for
#
# Convert VM to template

```

## Provision Cluster
```bash
# Set env variables
export TF_VAR_cloudflare_api_token=READ_WRITE_TOKEN
export TF_VAR_cloudflare_zone_id=DOMAIN_ZONEID
export TF_VAR_vm_user_username=anders
export TF_VAR_vm_user_sshkey="SSH PUBLIC ID for authentication"
export TF_VAR_proxmox_username=USERNAME@pam
export TF_VAR_proxmox_password=PROXMOX_PASSWORD
export TF_VAR_proxmox_api_url=https://PROXMOX_SERVER:8006/api2/json


# Initialize openTofu
cd admin
tofu init

# Bootstrap the cluster
./patch_infra.sh 
```


## Setup Cillium CNI
```bash
# Create BGP Password
kubectl create secret generic -n kube-system --type=string bgp-auth-secret --from-literal=password=REPLACEWITHPASSWORD
# Run from root of repo
# Sets up BGP peerings, otherwise things just crashloop
# Flux will maintain this, but without this applied flux can't access the source repo due to internet connectivity in the cluster not working
kubectl apply -k cluster/infra/cilium/
```

## Setup fluxCD
```bash
flux bootstrap github \
  --token-auth \
  --owner=andersballegaard \
  --repository=homelab-k8s \
  --branch=main \
  --path=cluster \
  --personal
```
